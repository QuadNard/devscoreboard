# Background and motivation

I never really got into quiz game that test developers on coding questions with a reward system that encourages the player to continue to study on typical interview and coding questions. Fastforward now I'm
recreating it but with the focus on UX first and multiplayer last.

# Roadmap

As mentioned above in the disclaimer, DevscoreBoard is still a work in progress and
is missing some features. In the following stages of development I'm planning
to implement the following features:

## Alpha

- [ ] player animation/UX
- [ ] Final win/lose page
- [ ] Simple title screen with basic info (about, source code, etc.) and a start button
- [ ] create multiple modals 
- [ ] ...
